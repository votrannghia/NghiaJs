	LIST OF COMMON METHODS INSIDE A REACT COMPONENT INCLUDE (STATELESS AND STATEFUL)


	I. THE MAIN ACTION:
		1. render(){}   ---> Responsible for generating React Element.
			+ Output: 
				1. React Element (JSX element is essentially a plain Javascript object)
				2. EVENTs raised to the HIGH component.
			+ Inputs: 
				PRE-MADE [state, prop, helper state == data selft generated...]

		2. Handlers
			+ For handling the INTERNAL EVENTs of component itself
			+ For handling the EVENTs raised from the LOW components ( the CHILD components)
				=> pass these handlers's ADDRESSES to the LOW component via PROPS

	II. THE HELPER METHODs
		1. Init Content - Information - Data
			constructor(){} ---> Responsible for initing something for the FIRST rendering.
			+ Inputs: state, props, helper state
			+ Outputs: PREPARED content for the first rendering.

		2. Calling API to get latest data [internal database, 3rd parties]

		3. Some algorithm helper methods

		4. MAKE-UP content
			+ Output: JSX || PURE content?

		5. EVENT Handlers - (with arguments)

		6. Do some compute-calculate on the data.

		7. Search, Filter, Sort, Paging, Group content

		8. Create new, Update existing, Delete existing content.

		9. Managing state, props changes
			Do something MORE when state and props changes. MOT CACH CHU DONG.

		10. Lifecycle Methods Hook t[BORN ; LIVING-GROWING ; DEAD]

		11. On receive the new STATEs

		12. On receive the new PROPs from the parent component

		13. Dynamically classes for styling

		14. Dynamically premade content

			13 + 14 due to STATE + PROPS

	III. REMEMBER
		HOW React handling render a LIST, ARRAY, inside Table, Grid, Flex

		Everytime an Event-Handler is invoked. There are 2 cases:
			1. Do rendering ----> setState() -> re-render the UI
			2. Just react to users on UI

		Understand callback - promise - async/await, event-loop
