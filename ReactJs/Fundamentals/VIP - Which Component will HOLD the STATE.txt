		PROBLEM:	There are some components, one is HIGH, some are LOW
					So, Which will hold the state?
						LOW should hold the state?
						
		SOLVE:
					There are 2 cases:
					
					1. If these 3 components belong to a "group"
					=>	The HIGH should host the STATE for data synced!!!
					
					2. If there is a LOW need some private calculation
					=> It should host some own private state.
