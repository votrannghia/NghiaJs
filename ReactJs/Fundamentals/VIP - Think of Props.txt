                            component (handlers for EVENTs raised from the LOW).

                            2. This is a good way to centralize managing the state in the parent component, and
                            avoid children to have the need to have their own state

                            3. Most of your components will just display some kind of information based on the props they
                            received, and stay stateless. (REPRESENTATIONAL component)



                            Props as a pointers point to a bundle of {data and handlers}
