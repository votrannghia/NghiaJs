    Ex: Tables of movies
        Each times user change Filter, Sorter, Pagination
        => The collection is changed:
            + about Order
            + about Elements
        => The table need this collection
        
        => The table need to give the sorter to the CONTAINER component. (After users make an impact on the UI - EVENT)
            => The CONTAINER component then will reset the state => lead to re-render the table.



        REPONSIBILITIES:
            + PRESENTATION component is to give some information to the CONTAINER one in order that It can update the STATE
                Eg: Table give the sorter{criteria, order} to the CONTAINER
            + CONTAINER component is to change the STATE reply on the useful information from the PRESENTATIONAL
