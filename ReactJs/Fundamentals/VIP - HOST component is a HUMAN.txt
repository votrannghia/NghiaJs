	HOST component = BRAIN + BODY



	I. BRAIN = { REMEMBER + BEHAVIORS}
		+ REMEMBER info at STATE = [PERSISTENCE info + HELPER info]
		+ BEHAVIORS = [handleDelete, handleCreate, handleLike, hanldeUpdate, handleSort, handleFilter, ...]
		
		Problem:
			Identify WHICH info is PERSISTENCE info (sync to database)
					 WHICH info is HELPER info (just store in memory supporting for interact with users)
			HOW: CONSIDER which infos need to be remember over across users behaviors, actions.


	II. BODY = {RESENTATIONAL components = CONTROLLED components}
		+ When users touch the body, the body RAISED that EVENT to the BRAIN
