    HIGH LEVEL PROBLEM:
        WHERE WE WILL DO PAGINATING DATA?
            1. Server side
            2. Client side


    "DO PAGINATION, FILTER, SORTING, SEARCHING before RENDERING"


    1. Strategies:

    2. Problem:
        Client keep all the orignal data ?
    OR 
        Client request to get the useful(paginated data) from Server
        The paginating is delegated to Server.
    
CLEAN CODE:
    1. SHOULD keep the paginating feature REUSABLE across different features, different applications
    2. Keep the render() of movie clean, not be blow out
