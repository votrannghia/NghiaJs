	ALL ABOUT DESIGNING SYSMTEM WITH COMPONENTS

	INTERFACE of COMPONENT
		1. INPUTs - used for rendering UI
			+ Main State from database
			+ Helper State
		
		2. EVENTs for interact with users
		   & Handler addresses for these EVENTs.

		3. OUTPUTs:
			+ EVENTs raised to the HIGH
			+ React Element which created for rendering UI
		
		Tips: 
				+ Think of 2 kind of components: 
								HOST(CONTAINER) Component (HIGH)      -----         REPRESENTATIONAL Component (LOW)
									(Class Component)									(Functional Component)
									(Stateful Component)								(Stateless Component)

			 	+ Try to use the component before implement it, to see it need what INPUTs, OUTPUTs

				+ Ask myselft, this LOW component need WHAT to render the UI. or the UI of LOW depends on WHAT information. => INPUTs
				+ Handling the EVENTs is taken by WHICH component (HIGH or LOW)

		THE LOW COMPONENTs should be DECOUPLED from the HIGH.





		VARIOUS point of views:
			HIGH component = HOST = BACKEND = CONTAINER ====> interface with Redux
				=> Manage the STATE, making things work
			LOW component = CONTROLLED = PRESENTATIONAL = CHILD ====> concerned with the LOOK







	GOALS:
		+ FLEXIBLE
		+ MAINTAINABLE
		+ SCALABLE
		+ SPEED + PERFORMANCE
		+ TRONG 1 CUC COMPONENTS, LAM SAO MA KHI STATE THAY DOI, TA IT PHAI RENDER CAC React Element.


	COMPONET is a PIECE of UI, include:
		+ CONTENT = DATA = INFORMATION
		+ JSX tag
		+ STYLE for this UI


	RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COMPONENTS	
		1. INHERITANCE
		2. COMPOSITION
		6. IS-A vs HAS-A
		4. AGGREGATION


		CONSUMER/CLIENT   ----------------------------------------------- PROVIDER/SERVER
		3. DEPENDENCY
		5. DELEGATION

		COMPONENT should be built from from TOP --------> DOWN, from PARENT ------> CHILDs.
		(From Result -----> COMPOSING conditions, factors, elements)


	HOW setState work


	SOURCES of DATA: 
		List, Array, Set, Map, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, HashTable, TreeTable (ORDERED)

	
	COMMON UIs:
		+ "Text": hx, label, span, p
		+ Form
		+ Table
		+ ListBox
		+ GridBox
		+ FlexBox
		+ Action UIs: [Button, CheckBox, RadioButton, TextBox, ...]

	A Component should DO THE ONE THING
