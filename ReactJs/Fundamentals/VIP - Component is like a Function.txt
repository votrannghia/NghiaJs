	Story:
		At HIGH
			<div class="container">
				<LOW
					input1={value1}
					input2={value2}
					input3={value3} />
			</div>
			
			=> We call "function" named "LOW" with 3 parameter:
				input1, input2, input3.
			
			=> Inside the "function" LOW, we have usage of 3 these above inputs


	Reverse: DESIGNING a REUSABLE COMPONENT:
		0. Identify the OUTPUT(returned result) of the "Function"
		1. Define name of "Function"
		2. Identify essential inputs for computing inside the "function"
	
		=> Who(COMPONENT) wana use this reusabel Component("Function"),
			must provide 3 above inputs.
		=> Receiving inputs is perform via the PROPS

		At LOW:
			To access the above inputs, we use:
				this.props.input1
				this.props.input2
				this.props.input3
