I. MOUNTING PHASE

    0. constructor()
        1. Called once when the instanace of componet is created.
        2. The best place to initiallize some properties in the class component
        3. No call this.setState here ====> this.state = something // OK

    1. render() -> generate very NEWEST Virtual DOM ( called React Element - essentially a plain Javascript Object)

    (*) -> Virtual DOM RENDERED to the DOM.

    2. componentDidMount()
        1. Called after the component is RENDERED INTO the DOM
        2. The PERFECT place to make a AJAX call to fetch data from server
            componentDidMount() {
                // AJAX call to get latest data
                this.setState({new data })
                // Do something afeter
            }

    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {

    }


II. UPDATING PHASE

    0. Somewhere in Component call setState( {} ), 
                              Which SCHEDULEs a call to render() method in future. (EVENT LOOP)

    (*) React might make a copy of the current Virtual DOM. (it will be called OLD_Virtual_DOM at step 2)

    1. render() -> generate a NEW virtual DOM.

    2. React compare NEW virtual DOM with OLD virtual DOM. => to figure out What has changed.
        CHANGE = React.compare(OLD_Virtual_DOM, NEW_Virtual_DOM);
    
    3. React base on the CHANGE to update it into the DOM.
        React.doUpdate(CHANGE, the DOM);

    4. componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState){
        // The best place to do some AJAX call to get data from server like:
        if (needToFetchNewestDataFromServer(prevProps, prevState)) {
            make a AJAX call here.
        }

            
    }

III. UNMOUNTING PHASE
