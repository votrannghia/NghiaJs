                                        INTERACTING BETWEEN CONTAINER COMPONENT - PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENT


                                        1. HIGH COMPONENT - CONTAINER COMPONENT - HOST state COMPONENT
                                            + Give information to LOW components(Presentational Components)
                                            + Delegate Describing What the UI look like to LOW component (Presentational Components)
                                            + Responsibility:
                                                Hold the STATE shared across components to keep it sync
                                                Handling EVENTs raised from the LOW components.


                                        2. LOW component - PRESENTATIONAL component
                                            + Receive information from HIGH components
                                            + Delegate handling EVENTs to the HIGH components
                                            + Responsibility:
                                                Use information(PROPS) from the HIGH components + internal STATE(optional) => Describing What the UI look like
                                                Return the React Element


                                        3. HIGH component do not know how to render at LOW
                                        => The HIGH do DELEGATING STATE to the LOW
                                            => The LOW do its describing the UI

                                            "The HIGH transfer data to the LOW;
                                            The LOW use received data to DESCRIBING the UI."
                                            All via props.

                                        4. The LOW do not HOST state
                                            => It does not know how to handle EVENTs from user
                                            => The LOW delegate the handling EVENTs to the HIGH
                                            The HIGH host state, so it know how to handle EVENTs from user.
                                            
                                            "The HIGH host STATE, know how to handle EVENTs
                                            The LOW delegate handling EVENTs to the HIGH."
                                            How: The HIGH give the LOW the ADDRESS of the handler via props
