Filtered ======= Sorted >>>>>>>>>>> Paginated

Flow:
    Step1: Filtered by conditions => output filteredResult
    Step2: Sorted by conditions[ {criteria, order}, {criteria2, order}, ...]
    Step3: Paginated => get apart from Sorted.

    => PROBLEM: Each time reload, we must flow these step through step1 and step2


PAGINATION:
            const paginated = paginate(allMovies, pageSize, pageNumber);
            => Change pageNumber => Change sub-set data
            



    1. Filtered
    2. Sort
    3. Pagination


    filtered = filter(
                        original data set,
                        criterial for filtering
                    );

    sorted = sort(
                    filtered
                    criterial for sorting
                );
    
    pagination = paginate(
                            filtered + sorted data,
                            pageSize,
                            totalItems
                        );
