                DESIGN COMPONENT WITH BOTTOM-UP APPROACH

        S1. BREAK THE WHOLE UI into PIECEs
        S2. START FROM THE LOWEST PIECE of UI
        S3. EACH UI PIECE, we define:
            * INTERFACE component.
                INPUTs:
                        1. Event Handler References
                            Eg: onSort, onLike, onDelete, onPageChange...
                        2. Pure Data (MAIN data for rendering + HELPER data): list, array of data
                        3. JSX (children React element)
                        4. Wrapper (Eg: textProperty(name); idProperty(_id))
                OUTPUT:
                        React Element (from render() method)
            
            * ADDITIONAL Process before RAISING Events Up the HIGH
                Eg: At LOW, we have:
                    handleBeforeRaiseEventToTheHIGH = item => {
                        // DO something more before RAISING the EVENT to the HIGH
                        this.props.onSort(item);  ====> Delegate handling events to the HIGH component
                    }

            * STATE = {MAIN State = Persistence Data}   u   {HELPER State = for supporting computing, interact}
