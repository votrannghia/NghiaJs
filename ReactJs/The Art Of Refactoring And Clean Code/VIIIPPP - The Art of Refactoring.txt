				IDENTIFY
				
					1. Which PART is COMMON and able to REUSE across components
						+ Ex: Validation, Log

					2. Which PART is INDIVIDUAL for a SPECIFIC component.
						+ Ex: Some individual state(hard state, static state) for each specific component.



					Techniques to archieve the goal:
						1. Delegate + Abstraction + Inheritance
						2. Interface
						3. Composition
						4. performAnAction() {
							doBefore();
							doTheMain();  ---> Delegate to sub components.
							doAfter();
						}
						
						5. Destructuring
					
						(6). In a "BLOCK" of code.
							Each LINE should have the same abstraction level.



					Trade off - No solution is absolutely perfect.
